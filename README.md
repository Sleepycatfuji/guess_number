Installing Homebrewpermalink
When it comes to installing software on your Mac, we need only one package manager, and it's Homebrew.

It can install any package or software you want and even install specific versions.

Quick guide: Run the following command in your terminal:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh>)"`
Installing PHP with Homebrew on Macpermalink
To install PHP, we can run the following command:

`brew install php`
This will install the latest stable version of PHP (At the moment of writing, this is PHP 8.0).

Before running any brew commands, it's a good habit to run the following commands first. These will check if Homebrew is all up to date and running the latest versions.

`brew update`
`brew doctor`
